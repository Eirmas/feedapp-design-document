    "## Introduction <a id=\"introduction\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In this initial design and prototyping assignment, we will outline the development of an IoT-cloud software system. The primary aim is to explore IoT and cloud technologies, design principles, and software platforms. This assignment lays the groundwork for a more extensive project in the second part of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose <a id=\"introduction_purpose\">\n",
    "The primary purpose of this IoT-Cloud Software System is to enable users to create polls and collect feedback via web/mobile applications or specialized IoT voting devices. The system aims to provide an efficient and seamless solution for the collection and management of responses, enhancing user engagement and real-time feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Use Cases <a id=\"introduction_key_use_cases\">\n",
    "- Poll Creation and Management: Users can create and manage polls through the system. Multiple polls can be defined, and users have the flexibility to handle past, present, and future polls concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- IoT Device Integration: The system supports the integration of IoT feedback and display devices with specific polls. This feature ensures that each IoT device is associated with the appropriate poll for data submission and presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Poll Activation: Users can initiate polls, optionally setting time limits. Participants can access polls using unique numbers or provided links, similar to popular platforms like Kahoot. Polls can be configured as either public, allowing open participation, or private, requiring user accounts and login for feedback submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Real-Time Feedback: The IoT-Cloud Software System excels in providing real-time feedback to participants. Vital information, such as current vote counts, is displayed on a web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Poll Closure: Polls can be closed by administrators or users, marking the end of the feedback collection phase. Upon closure, the system processes and stores the results for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "These key use cases form the core functionality of the IoT-Cloud Software System, offering users an efficient means to create, manage, and participate in polls."

The collaborative efforts of the development team, guided by this document, will shape the realization of this system in the second part of the course. We acknowledge that the system's successful implementation will require careful planning, iterative design, and rigorous testing. The development methodology, inspired by IoT and software architecture principles, will serve as a valuable guide.\n",
